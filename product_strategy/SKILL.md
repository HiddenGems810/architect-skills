# Product Strategy & Business Viability

You have access to the frameworks used by successful startup founders and product managers. Use this to validate ideas, define MVPs, and maximize business value.

## 1. Finding Product-Market Fit (PMF)

### The "Hair on Fire" Problem
*   **Principle**: Solve problems that are urgent, painful, and frequent.
*   **Validation**: If users aren't actively looking for a solution (or hacking one together), your market might be too weak.

### The Mom Test (Rob Fitzpatrick)
*   **Rule**: Never ask "Is this a good idea?"
*   **Method**: Ask about their life/work. "Tell me about the last time you encountered X." "How much did that cost you?" "What else have you tried?"
*   **Goal**: Extract facts, not compliments.

### Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
*   **Concept**: Users don't buy products; they "hire" them to do a job.
*   **Example**: You don't buy a drill; you hire it to make a hole (or really, to hang a picture to feel at home).
*   **Application**: Focus on the *outcome*, not the *feature*.

## 2. The Lean Startup Methodology

### Build-Measure-Learn Loop
*   **Cycle**: minimizing the total time through the loop.
*   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: The smallest thing you can build that allows you to complete the loop (learn). It is NOT a "half-broken" product; it is a scoped-down solution.

### Pivot vs. Persevere
*   **Pivot**: A fundamental change in strategy without a change in vision. (e.g., zoom-in pivot, customer segment pivot).
*   **Persevere**: Optimizing the current strategy.

## 3. Pricing & Monetization

### Value-Based Pricing
*   **Rule**: Price based on the value you create, not your costs + margin.
*   **Method**: If your tool saves a developer 10 hours a month ($1000 value), charging $50/mo is a no-brainer.

### Psychology of Pricing
*   **Anchoring**: Show a high-priced "Enterprise" plan to make the "Pro" plan look like a bargain.
*   **Decoy Effect**: Add an option that is clearly inferior to the target option to push users toward the target.

## 4. Prioritization Frameworks

### ICE Score
*   **Impact**: How big is the win? (1-10)
*   **Confidence**: How sure are we it will work? (1-10)
*   **Ease**: How easy is it to build? (1-10)
*   **Formula**: (I * C * E) = Score. Sort backlog by Score.

### RICE Score (Intercom)
*   **Reach**: How many users will this impact?
*   **Impact**: How much will it increase the goal?
*   **Confidence**: How sure are we?
*   **Effort**: Person-months to build.
*   **Formula**: (R * I * C) / E.

## 5. Strategic Moats (Helmer's 7 Powers)

1.  **Scale Economies**: Unit cost drops as volume grows.
2.  **Network Effects**: Value increases as more users join (Marketplaces, Social).
3.  **Counter-Positioning**: Doing something the incumbent *cannot* do without hurting their existing business.
4.  **Switching Costs**: It's painful to leave (Data lock-in, Learning curve).
5.  **Branding**: Attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering.
6.  **Cornered Resource**: Exclusive access to a valuable asset (Patents, Talent).
7.  **Process Power**: Embedded efficiency that is hard to copy (Toyota Way).
