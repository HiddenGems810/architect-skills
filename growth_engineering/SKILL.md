# Growth Engineering & User Acquisition

You have access to the tactical playbook for acquiring and retaining users at scale. Use this to design features that market themselves.

## 1. Product-Led Growth (PLG)

### Time to Value (TTV)
*   **Goal**: Minimize the time from "Sign Up" to "Aha Moment" (First value).
*   **Tactic**: Remove email confirmation friction. Use "Lazy Registration" (let them use the app before asking for an account).

### Freemium vs. Free Trial
*   **Freemium**: Good for broad markets. Acquire cheap, upsell later. Risk: High support cost for free users.
*   **Reverse Trial**: Give full Pro access for 14 days, then downgrade to Free. proven to convert better than "Start with Free".

## 2. Viral Loops & Referrals

### The Viral Coefficient (K-factor)
*   **Definition**: The number of new users each existing user invites.
*   **Goal**: K > 1 = Exponential Growth.
*   **Formula**: K = (Invites sent per user) * (Conversion rate of invites).

### Incentivized Referrals (Dropbox Model)
*   **Mechanism**: Give value (Storage, Credits) to BOTH the sender and the receiver. Two-sided incentives work best.

### Powered By Loops
*   **Mechanism**: "Sent from iPhone", "Powered by Vercel".
*   **Tactic**: Make your free tier product a billboard for your service.

## 3. SEO & Content Engineering

### Programmatic SEO
*   **Concept**: Generate thousands of landing pages for long-tail keywords using data + templates.
*   **Example**: TripAdvisor having a page for "Best Hotels in [City]" for every city in the world.
*   **Implementation**: Database of entities -> Page Template -> sitemap.xml.

### Content Clusters (Hub and Spoke)
*   **Structure**: One massive "Pillar Page" (broad topic) linking to/from many "Cluster Pages" (specific sub-topics). Signals authority to search engines.

## 4. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

### The LIFT Model
*   **Value Proposition**: The core driver.
*   **Relevance**: Does the page match what the user searched for?
*   **Clarity**: Is the offer easy to understand?
*   **Urgency**: Why now?
*   **Distraction**: Remove nav links on checkout pages.
*   **Anxiety**: Add trust badges, testimonials, and guarantees.

### A/B Testing Statistics
*   **Rule**: Don't peek. Wait for statistical significance (usually 95%).
*   **metric**: Focus on the OEC (Overall Evaluation Criterion), not vanity metrics.

## 5. Retention & Engagement

### Hook Model (Nir Eyal)
1.  **Trigger**: External (Push notification) or Internal (Boredom).
2.  **Action**: Simple behavior done in anticipation of reward.
3.  **Variable Reward**: The "slot machine" effect. Sometimes you get a like, sometimes you don't.
4.  **Investment**: User puts work in (Profile, Data), increasing switching costs.

### Churn Prevention
*   **Dunning**: Smart retries for failed credit cards.
*   **Offboarding Flow**: Ask why they are leaving. Offer a "Pause" instead of "Cancel".
